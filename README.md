   - Run comprehensive baseline security audit
   - Review categorized results (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
   - Understand security score and overall risk assessment
   - Export initial audit report for documentation

2. **Remediation Process:**
   - Address critical vulnerabilities immediately
   - Use built-in fix actions where available
   - Follow step-by-step instructions for manual fixes
   - Re-audit to verify remediation effectiveness

#### Security Check Categories
1. **System Integrity Checks:**
   - Firmware password and Secure Boot status
   - System integrity protection (SIP) verification

2. **Privacy & Permissions:**
   - Application privacy permissions review
   - Location services and tracking settings
   - Microphone and camera access controls
   - File and folder access permissions

#### Network Security Assessment
1. **Connection Security:**
   - Firewall status and configuration
   - Remote access services (SSH, Screen Sharing)
   - Network sharing settings
   - VPN and proxy configurations

2. **Browser & Application Security:**
   - Browser security settings and extensions
   - Application sandboxing and isolation
   - Code signing and notarization checks
   - Known vulnerable software detection

#### Reporting & Analytics
1. **Audit Reports:**
   - Generate detailed security assessment reports

   - Create remediation workflows for teams

#### Performance Optimization
1. **Audit Efficiency:**
   - Configure audit depth based on system resources
   - Set up intelligent scanning to avoid redundant checks
   - Manage cache for faster repeated audits
   - Optimize for different system configurations

2. **Resource Management:**
   - Monitor system impact during security scans
   - Schedule audits during low-usage periods
   - Configure background operation priorities
   - Manage audit data storage and retention

#### Troubleshooting
- **Permission Issues:** Verify Full Disk Access and Accessibility permissions, restart application
- **Incomplete Audits:** Check for conflicting security software, run with administrator privileges
- **False Positives:** Adjust check sensitivity, update application database, report issues
- **Performance Problems:** Reduce audit scope, clear cache, optimize system resources

#### Best Practices
